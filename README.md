# Performance-Evaluation-of-Thread-based-and-Process-based-Matrix-Multiplication
Implemented a parallel matrix multiplication program using threads and processes, optimizing memory with Copy-On-Write (COW). Evaluated creation/deletion performance and memory allocation, using semaphores for synchronization.
